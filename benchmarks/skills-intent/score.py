"""Rank the expected skill for each labelled query.

    python3 -I score.py XERJ_BIN URL QUERIES.tsv RESULTS.tsv

Runs `xerj search --url URL --prefix skills -k 50 --json QUERY` for each
`query<TAB>expected` line, folds the passages into skills (a hit's path starts
with its skill folder), and records the expected skill's rank among the first
10 distinct skills, or `miss`. Every row is kept, misses included. Prints the
top-1, top-3 and top-10 counts. Standard library only.
